# C chatroom

C Chatroom is a chat app in C language using Socket and Thread.
The source codes are split into 2 parts, client and server. The server-side listens to its port, accepts connections, receives any message from a client, and sends it to other clients while the client-side can send the message to the server and listen for any messages from the server.
